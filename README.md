# odin-recipes
My first attempt at a basic HTML based page for recipes.
This project will demonstrate basic understanding of navigating Unix directories, basic HTML knowlege including using anchor and image elements, necessary attributes like href for links and alt for image descriptions.  I will use relatvie and absolute references, and us ../ to reference parent directories.
