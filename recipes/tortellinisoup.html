    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        This is an extremely popular soup on reddit, 
        intended for a slow cooker where you just jam all the shit in and roll.
        This is meant for a dutch oven, but any big pot is fine.  
        It's a red soup that has some veggies thrown in with sausage and tortellini,
        with cream and flour added for thickening.

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the sausage in olive oil, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Fry onion in olive oil for as long as you'd like.  
            Add garlic for 2-3 minutes when the onions are near done.</li>
        <li>Make a little clear space to fry the spices in olive oil, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Fry the flour in the oil for a few minutes, stirring it.</li>
        <li>Fry the tomato paste for 1-2 mins, then add tomatos, then add broth.</li>
        <li>Add the sausage, parmesan rind, and bay leaves back in once it's burbling.</li>
        <li>Cook this for at least 0.5 hours, Ashlee does less Travis do longer.</li>
        <li>10 mins before completion, add heavy cream, zuchini, broccoli, and mushrooms.</li>
        <li>When you are satisfied with the outcome (TASTE IT!!!!!!!!!! ADD SALT (and maybe drops of red wine vinegar)) add tortellini for the suggested time.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Really you can freestyle on any of the cook times or veggies, 
        the OG recipe suggests spinach. I don't.  Add a chile of your choice. or ten.</li>
    </ul>
